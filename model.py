'''
1. What if the time entered by the user is greater than the allowed time of 7200 seconds ?

This is answered on line 47-49 of my thonny script. If either session entered by the user
is greater than 7200 a string will be outputted saying the session is invalid.

2. What if the screen time while using the embedded system was greater than without ?

This is answered on lines 80-83 of my python script. A message will be output to the user
telling them that they need to take more drastic action such as leaving their device out of
the room.

3. What if the user was to continue to use the embedded system during their study sessions ?

This is answered on line 67 of my python script. This tells the users the estimated benefits
they will receive if they were to use the embedded system in there next five study sessions.
