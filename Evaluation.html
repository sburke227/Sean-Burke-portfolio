  <h2>Evaluation(484 words)</h2>
  <p>The original intention of my project was to improve the wellbeing of the user. The end users of my project will be students. In particular students who are preparing to complete their Leaving Certificate. This can be a difficult time for students and can impact quite negatively on their emotional and mental wellbeing. I believe that my project targets one of the most prominent sources of negativity to students. The presence of a mobile phone in a workspace has a huge negative impact, therefore through the elimination of this negativity then positive consequences occur, which I feel through my experience of testing my embedded system on my study that this certainly proved to be true.</P>
   <P> Although I feel as though the goal of my embedded system has been fulfilled, I feel that with a longer time period and constant iteration that my project could be much more effective. 
   <p>The first area I would like to have improved upon with more time is within my model. My model starts with asking the user to input 12 integers. These integers are data that were stored in the csv file from session 1 and session 2, yes the data being inputted is still the same. I would like to be able to take the data straight from the csv file to the model without the need for them to input the data themselves. Another change I would make to this part of the model would be to choose the amount of inputs they would like to make.</P>
    
   <p>The second area of my project I would like to improve is in my unit testing. Ideally within my unit I would have had a unit test in place to test every single piece of my model but unfortunately this was not possible within the given time frame. I ensured to test the areas of my code I felt to be more important and the pieces that an issue could likely arise from.</P>
    
   <p>The final area of my project I would like to have improved if I was to iterate my project would be within my survey. This is due to the survey size. I would like to have conducted a much larger survey as the larger the sample size, the more accurate the results would be(Ref 7)”Larger sample sizes are typically better because they reduce the likelihood of sampling errors and provide a more accurate representation of the population”.</P>
    
   <p>I mentioned in my investigation section some of the consequences affecting my peers. These were major focuses of my project as some of these also affected me.  The one I decided to focus on was the recurrence of procrastination. I believe that the alarm on my embedded system encouraged users to complete tasks without distractions so they could use their phone. Although the intentions behind this are poor this time away from mobile devices improves their mental wellbeing.</P>
