  <h3>Pre existing types of technology used to improve wellbeing:</h3>
  <p>
    There are many pre existing types of technology that benefit our wellbeing. Especially our physical wellbeing. An example of this include equipment such as a whoop band(Ref 1). The whoop band helps to track data such as sleep quality, heart rate and recovery rate.</p>
    
  <p>The presence of a mobile phone in a workspace can have huge negative impacts on a students wellbeing. This is incentivised by the constant intake of notifications received by the user. The sound of a notification or output of the phone's vibration causes an immediate desire by the user to pick up and interact with the device. Fighting this desire can “send our brains into overdrive and trigger the release of stress hormones like cortisol when we hear a notification sound or feel our phone vibrate, our brain interprets it as something that demands immediate attention. This can put us in a constant state of alertness, leading to heightened stress.”(Ref 2). </p>
    
  <p>When I asked other pupils in sixth and fifth year to reflect on the study they have completed I found the following critical consequences to be recurring answers:</p>
    <ul>
   <li> Constant procrastination and putting off tasks to allow use of  a mobile phone.</li>
   <li> Lack of focus and concentration as each time a notification was received the student wished to check their phone.</li>
   <li> Poor retention of information due to constant distraction.</li>
   <li> Developing a habit of unnecessary multitasking.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>After realising the issues that students faced, I began to research what I could do to eliminate this distraction. My initial idea was to remove the distraction from the workspace. I did this by leaving my phone outside the room. This solution proved to be ineffective as I was just encouraged to leave the room and get my phone.</p>
  <p> I then came up with a new idea. I found an app on my phone called Opal(Ref 3) that would limit the amount of time I could spend on my phone so it removed the incentive to use it. This proved very effective and improved my productivity.</p>
    
  <p>Although this proved to be an effective method to improve the quality of my study, it had one big flaw. This was because it cost money to maintain a subscription. 

  <p>This app still majorly benefitted me to help research my hypothesis. So far I had realized that maybe the device being in the workspace is not the problem but rather the desire to use the device. I then came to a conclusion of how I could complete this.</p>
